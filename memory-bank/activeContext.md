# Cline JetBrains Java Implementation Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on completing the implementation of the Cline JetBrains plugin using pure Java. We've made significant progress on both the UI components and backend services, including API communication, tool execution, file system operations, and browser functionality. We've also implemented markdown rendering, image support, and code block rendering.

Specifically, we have completed:
1. API communication for sending and receiving messages (ClineApiService)
2. Tool execution functionality (ToolExecutor and ToolRegistry)
3. Terminal command execution (ClineTerminalService)
4. File system operations (ClineFileService)
5. Browser functionality (ClineBrowserService)
6. Markdown rendering, image support, and code block rendering
7. Unit tests for core components

Our current focus is on:
1. Expanding test coverage for all components
2. UI polish and additional enhancements
3. Integrating all tools with the UI
4. Documentation

   - Implement integration tests
   - Add test coverage reporting
   - Test with different JetBrains IDEs

2. **UI Polish**:
   - Add animations and transitions
   - Improve error handling and user feedback
   - Ensure consistent styling across all components

3. **Tool Integration**:
   - Integrate all tools with the UI
   - Implement additional tool types
   - Ensure proper error handling for tool execution

### Medium-term Tasks
1. **Documentation**:
   - Create user documentation
   - Add developer documentation
   - Update README and other project documentation

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize message rendering for large conversations
   - Improve memory usage
   - Reduce UI lag during long operations

3. **Feature Parity**:
   - Ensure all features from the VSCode version are implemented
   - Add any JetBrains-specific features

### Long-term Tasks
1. **Distribution**:
   - Prepare for release on the JetBrains Marketplace
   - Create release notes and marketing materials

2. **Maintenance**:
   - Set up continuous integration
   - Establish a release process
   - Plan for future updates and maintenance

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### API Communication
We've implemented a robust API communication service that supports both synchronous and streaming responses. The service includes proper error handling and a test mode for unit testing.

### Tool Execution
We've implemented a modular tool execution system with a common interface and base class for all tools. This makes it easy to add new tools and ensures consistent behavior across all tools. The ToolRegistry class is responsible for registering all available tools with the ToolExecutor.

### UI Components
We've implemented all the necessary UI components for the plugin, including markdown rendering, image support, and code block rendering. These components provide a rich user experience similar to the VSCode version.

### Threading Model
We're using CompletableFuture for asynchronous operations, ensuring that UI operations are performed on the EDT (Event Dispatch Thread) and long-running operations are executed in background threads. This is a key consideration for JetBrains plugin development.

### Error Handling
We've implemented robust error handling throughout the application, with clear feedback to the user when errors occur. This is especially important for operations that interact with external systems, such as the AI API or the file system.

### Testing Strategy
We're using JUnit 5 for testing, with Mockito for mocking external dependencies. This allows us to test components in isolation and ensure they behave correctly under various conditions.

## Current Challenges

### Performance
Ensuring good performance, especially for large conversations with many messages, is a key challenge. We need to implement efficient rendering and consider virtualization for large lists.

### Testing
Testing the UI components thoroughly is challenging. We need to develop a good testing strategy that covers both unit testing and integration testing.

### Integration with JetBrains IDEs
Ensuring the plugin works well with all JetBrains IDEs is a challenge. We need to test with different IDEs and ensure compatibility.

### Documentation
Creating comprehensive documentation for both users and developers is a significant task. We need to document all aspects of the plugin, including its architecture, components, and usage.

## Resolved Challenges

### Markdown Rendering
We've successfully implemented markdown rendering using a combination of JTextPane and HTML rendering. This provides a rich text experience for message content.

### Code Block Rendering
We've implemented code block rendering with syntax highlighting using JetBrains' editor components. This provides a familiar and consistent experience for code blocks.

### Image Support
We've added support for images in messages using the ImageRenderer class. This allows users to see images directly in the chat interface.

### File System Operations
We've implemented comprehensive file system operations, including reading and writing files, searching for files, and applying diffs to files. These operations are essential for the plugin's functionality.
