# Cline JetBrains Java Implementation Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on completing the implementation of the Cline JetBrains plugin using pure Java. We've made significant progress on both the UI components and backend services, including API communication, tool execution, file system operations, and browser functionality. We've also implemented markdown rendering, image support, and code block rendering.

We have completed a detailed comparison between the TypeScript and Java implementations to identify gaps and missing features, and created a comprehensive plan for implementing these features.

Specifically, we have completed:
1. API communication for sending and receiving messages (ClineApiService)
2. Tool execution functionality (ToolExecutor and ToolRegistry)
3. Terminal command execution (ClineTerminalService)
4. File system operations (ClineFileService)
5. Browser functionality (ClineFileService) - stub implementation
6. Markdown rendering, image support, and code block rendering
7. Unit tests for core components
8. TypeScript-Java comparison document
9. Feature implementation plan

Our current focus is on:
1. Implementing full browser functionality using JxBrowser or similar library
2. Adding support for multiple API providers
3. Implementing prompt caching for Claude 3.5
4. Adding MCP integration
5. Implementing auto-approval for tools
6. Adding UI animations

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks
1. **Browser Functionality Implementation**:
   - Add JxBrowser dependency to the project
   - Implement a proper BrowserSession class that manages browser instances
   - Implement screenshot capture functionality
   - Implement console log capture
   - Implement browser settings configuration
   - Update the BrowserActionTool to use the new implementation
   - Add tests for the browser functionality

2. **Multiple API Providers Support**:
   - Create an ApiProvider interface
   - Implement provider-specific classes (AnthropicProvider, OpenAiProvider, etc.)
   - Update ClineApiService to use the appropriate provider based on settings
   - Add provider-specific settings to ClineSettingsService
   - Update the settings UI to allow selecting the provider
   - Add tests for each provider

3. **Prompt Caching Implementation**:
   - Update the AnthropicProvider to support prompt caching
   - Add cache control headers to API requests
   - Add cache-related fields to the Message class
   - Update the StreamHandler to handle cache-related events
   - Add tests for prompt caching

### Medium-term Tasks
1. **MCP Integration**:
   - Create McpHub class to manage MCP servers
   - Implement McpServer interface and concrete implementations
   - Add MCP tool and resource access functionality
   - Update the ToolRegistry to include MCP tools
   - Add MCP settings to ClineSettingsService
   - Update the settings UI to configure MCP servers
   - Add tests for MCP functionality

2. **Auto-approval Implementation**:
   - Add auto-approval settings to ClineSettingsService
   - Update the ToolExecutor to check auto-approval settings
   - Add notification for auto-approved tools
   - Update the settings UI to configure auto-approval
   - Add tests for auto-approval functionality

3. **UI Animations**:
   - Implement fade-in/fade-out animations for messages
   - Add loading animations for API requests
   - Implement smooth scrolling for the chat view
   - Add transition animations for view changes

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Implementation Approach
We've decided to implement the missing features in a phased approach, starting with the most critical ones (browser functionality and multiple API providers) and then moving on to the less critical ones (MCP integration, auto-approval, and UI animations).

### Browser Implementation
For the browser implementation, we're considering using JxBrowser, which is a commercial library that provides a Chromium-based browser for Java applications. This will allow us to implement all the browser functionality that's available in the TypeScript version.

### API Providers
We'll implement an ApiProvider interface and provider-specific classes to support multiple API providers. This will allow users to choose their preferred provider and will make it easier to add support for new providers in the future.

### Testing Strategy
We'll continue to use JUnit 5 for testing, with Mockito for mocking external dependencies. We'll add tests for each new feature and ensure that all tests pass before merging the changes.

## Current Challenges

### Browser Implementation
Implementing a full browser functionality in Java is challenging. We need to find a suitable library (like JxBrowser) and integrate it with our plugin. We also need to implement screenshot capture and console log capture, which are essential for the browser functionality.

### Multiple API Providers
Supporting multiple API providers requires a significant refactoring of the ClineApiService class. We need to create an abstraction layer that can handle different API providers with different authentication methods and API endpoints.

### MCP Integration
Implementing MCP integration requires a good understanding of the MCP protocol and how it's used in the TypeScript version. We need to create a Java implementation of the MCP client and integrate it with our plugin.

## Resolved Challenges

### Markdown Rendering
We've successfully implemented markdown rendering using a combination of JTextPane and HTML rendering. This provides a rich text experience for message content.

### Code Block Rendering
We've implemented code block rendering with syntax highlighting using JetBrains' editor components. This provides a familiar and consistent experience for code blocks.

### Image Support
We've added support for images in messages using the ImageRenderer class. This allows users to see images directly in the chat interface.

### File System Operations
We've implemented comprehensive file system operations, including reading and writing files, searching for files, and applying diffs to files. These operations are essential for the plugin's functionality.
