# Cline JetBrains Java Implementation Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on implementing the core UI components for the Cline JetBrains plugin using pure Java. This involves creating Java equivalents of the TypeScript UI components, ensuring they have the same functionality and appearance, and integrating them with the JetBrains platform.

Specifically, we are working on:
1. Creating the main chat interface (ChatView)
2. Implementing message display components (ChatRow)
3. Building the settings panel (SettingsView)
4. Developing the history view (HistoryView)
5. Creating the tool testing interface (ToolTestView)
6. Integrating all components in the main tool window (ClineToolWindowContent)

## Recent Changes

### UI Components Implementation
- Created `ChatView` class to replace the TypeScript ChatView component
- Implemented `ChatRow` for displaying individual messages
- Created `TaskHeader` for displaying task information
- Implemented `HistoryView` for browsing conversation history
- Created `SettingsView` for configuring the plugin
- Implemented `ToolTestView` for testing tools

### Model Enhancements
- Enhanced the `Message` class with methods to identify message types:
  - `isToolUse()`: Checks if a message is a tool use request
  - `isCommand()`: Checks if a message is a command request
  - `isError()`: Checks if a message is an error message

### Integration
- Updated `ClineToolWindowContent` to use the new Java UI components
- Implemented a tabbed interface for switching between different views
- Added a toolbar for common actions
- Connected all components together for a cohesive user experience

### Build System
- Successfully built the plugin with the new Java UI components
- Fixed compilation issues related to JBTextField vs JBPasswordField

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks
1. **Complete UI Implementation**:
   - Implement markdown rendering for message content
   - Add support for images in messages
   - Implement code block rendering with syntax highlighting

2. **Functionality Implementation**:
   - Implement API communication for sending and receiving messages
   - Add support for tool execution
   - Implement terminal command execution
   - Add file system operations

3. **Testing**:
   - Create unit tests for core components
   - Perform manual testing of the UI
   - Test with different JetBrains IDEs

### Medium-term Tasks
1. **Polish UI**:
   - Ensure consistent styling across all components
   - Add animations and transitions
   - Improve error handling and user feedback

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize message rendering for large conversations
   - Improve memory usage
   - Reduce UI lag during long operations

3. **Documentation**:
   - Create user documentation
   - Add developer documentation
   - Update README and other project documentation

### Long-term Tasks
1. **Feature Parity**:
   - Ensure all features from the VSCode version are implemented
   - Add any JetBrains-specific features

2. **Distribution**:
   - Prepare for release on the JetBrains Marketplace
   - Create release notes and marketing materials

3. **Maintenance**:
   - Set up continuous integration
   - Establish a release process
   - Plan for future updates and maintenance

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### UI Framework Choice
We've decided to use Swing with JetBrains UI components (JB* classes) for the UI implementation. This approach ensures compatibility with all JetBrains IDEs and provides a consistent look and feel with the rest of the IDE.

### Component Structure
We've structured the UI components to mirror the TypeScript implementation, with separate classes for different parts of the UI. This makes it easier to maintain feature parity and ensures a consistent user experience across both versions.

### Service Integration
We're using the existing service classes (ClineApiService, ClineSettingsService, etc.) for backend functionality, with the new UI components communicating with these services. This maintains a clean separation of concerns and allows for easier testing and maintenance.

### Threading Model
We need to be careful about threading, ensuring that UI operations are performed on the EDT (Event Dispatch Thread) and long-running operations are executed in background threads. This is a key consideration for JetBrains plugin development.

### Error Handling
We're implementing robust error handling throughout the UI, with clear feedback to the user when errors occur. This is especially important for operations that interact with external systems, such as the AI API or the file system.

## Current Challenges

### Markdown Rendering
Implementing markdown rendering in Swing is challenging. We need to find a good approach that supports all the markdown features used in Cline messages while maintaining good performance.

### Code Block Rendering
Similar to markdown rendering, implementing syntax-highlighted code blocks in Swing is challenging. We may need to use JetBrains' editor components for this.

### Image Support
Adding support for images in messages requires careful consideration of how to load, display, and manage images in a Swing UI.

### Performance
Ensuring good performance, especially for large conversations with many messages, is a key challenge. We need to implement efficient rendering and consider virtualization for large lists.

### Testing
Testing the UI components thoroughly is challenging. We need to develop a good testing strategy that covers both unit testing and integration testing.
