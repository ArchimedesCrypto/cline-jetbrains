- **JBList**: Enhanced list component with JetBrains styling.

### External Libraries
- **Gson**: Used for JSON serialization and deserialization.
- **OkHttp**: Used for HTTP communication with the AI API.
- **JUnit**: Used for unit testing.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later
- Gradle 8.0 or later
- IntelliJ IDEA (preferably the Ultimate Edition for full plugin development support)
- JetBrains Plugin Development plugin for IntelliJ IDEA

```

### Build Process
1. **Compilation**: Java source files are compiled into class files.
2. **Resource Processing**: Resources are processed and included in the plugin.
3. **Plugin XML Generation**: The plugin.xml file is generated based on the build configuration.
4. **Packaging**: The compiled classes and resources are packaged into a JAR file.
5. **Plugin ZIP Creation**: The JAR file and any dependencies are packaged into a ZIP file for distribution.

### Development Workflow
1. **Setup**: Clone the repository and open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. **Build**: Run `./gradlew build` to build the plugin.
3. **Run**: Run `./gradlew runIde` to start an instance of IntelliJ IDEA with the plugin installed.
4. **Debug**: Use IntelliJ IDEA's debugging tools to debug the plugin.
5. **Test**: Run `./gradlew test` to run the unit tests.
6. **Package**: Run `./gradlew buildPlugin` to create a distributable plugin ZIP file.
