# Cline JetBrains Java Implementation Project Brief

## Project Overview
This project involves rebuilding the Cline plugin for JetBrains IDEs using pure Java instead of the current TypeScript bridge approach. The TypeScript bridge was causing issues with loading the UI, as evidenced by the "Failed to load the TypeScript UI" error. The goal is to create a native Java implementation that has feature parity with the VSCode version while leveraging JetBrains' UI components and APIs.

## Core Requirements
1. Create a new subfolder called `cline-jetbrains-java`
2. Use the gradle build settings from the existing `cline-jetbrains` folder
3. Rebuild the entire TypeScript UI and functionality in Java
4. Ensure feature parity with the VSCode version
5. Make it look and function identically to the TypeScript version

## Key Components
1. **UI Components**
   - Chat interface for interacting with the AI
   - Settings panel for configuration
   - History view for past conversations
   - Tool testing interface

2. **Core Functionality**
   - Message handling and display
   - API integration with AI models
   - File operations
   - Terminal command execution
   - Tool execution

3. **Integration Points**
   - JetBrains IDE integration
   - Editor integration
   - Terminal integration
   - File system integration

## Success Criteria
- The plugin builds successfully
- All UI components render correctly
- The plugin can communicate with AI models
- Users can send messages and receive responses
- The plugin can execute tools and commands
- The plugin can access and modify files

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Project setup and core architecture
- Phase 2: UI framework and basic functionality
- Phase 3: Advanced features and IDE integration
- Phase 4: Feature parity and polish

## Technical Constraints
- Must use Java for all implementation
- Must use JetBrains UI components
- Must be compatible with all JetBrains IDEs
- Must follow JetBrains plugin development best practices
