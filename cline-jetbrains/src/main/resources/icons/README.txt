This directory should contain the following icon files:

1. cline_icon.svg - Main icon for the plugin
2. cline_icon_dark.svg - Dark theme version of the icon
3. cline_icon_light.svg - Light theme version of the icon

These files should be created as SVG files with a size of 16x16 pixels.

For the initial implementation, you can copy the icon files from the main Cline repository:
- assets/icons/icon.svg
- assets/icons/robot_panel_dark.png (convert to SVG)
- assets/icons/robot_panel_light.png (convert to SVG)

The sync.sh script will attempt to copy these files automatically.
