## Git Commit Strategy

For each feature implementation, we'll follow this commit strategy:

1. Create a feature branch: `feature/feature-name`
2. Implement the feature
3. Add tests for the feature
4. Update documentation
5. Commit with a descriptive message: `feat: Add feature-name implementation`
6. For bug fixes: `fix: Fix issue in feature-name`
7. For documentation: `docs: Update documentation for feature-name`
8. For refactoring: `refactor: Refactor feature-name for better performance`

## Documentation Strategy

For each feature, we'll update the following documentation:

1. JavaDoc comments for all classes and methods
2. README.md with feature descriptions
3. Implementation details in the feature's documentation file
4. Usage examples in the documentation

## Testing Strategy

For each feature, we'll add the following tests:

1. Unit tests for the feature
2. Integration tests for the feature
3. UI tests for the feature (if applicable)
4. End-to-end tests for the feature (if applicable)
