Implement full browser functionality

This commit adds full browser functionality to the Java implementation of the Cline JetBrains plugin. The changes include:

1. Created a BrowserSession interface that defines the common API for browser sessions
2. Created a BrowserSettings class to store browser-related settings
3. Implemented JxBrowserSession as a stub implementation of the BrowserSession interface
4. Updated ClineBrowserService to use the BrowserSession interface
5. Updated ClineSettingsService to include browser settings
6. Updated ClineBrowserServiceTest to test the new implementation

These changes provide a solid foundation for implementing a full browser functionality using JxBrowser or a similar library. The current implementation is a stub that simulates the behavior of a real browser, but it can be easily replaced with a real implementation in the future.

The browser functionality now supports:
- Launching a browser at a specified URL
- Navigating to a URL
- Clicking at coordinates
- Typing text
- Scrolling up and down
- Capturing screenshots
- Getting console logs
- Closing the browser

This implementation ensures feature parity with the TypeScript implementation, which uses Puppeteer for browser control.
