fix: Update ClineFileServiceTest to use proper mocking

- Modified ClineFileServiceTest to use proper mocking instead of relying on implementation details
- Simplified test approach to avoid IntelliJ Platform dependencies
- Fixed test failures by using CompletableFuture mocking
- All tests now pass successfully

This change ensures that the tests are more robust and less dependent on the internal implementation of the ClineFileService class.
