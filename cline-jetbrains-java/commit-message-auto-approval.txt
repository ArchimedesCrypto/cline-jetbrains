Add auto-approval for tools

This commit adds auto-approval for tools to the Java implementation of the Cline JetBrains plugin. The changes include:

1. Created AutoApprovalSettings class to store auto-approval settings
2. Updated ClineSettingsService to include auto-approval settings
3. Added tests for the auto-approval settings

These changes provide a solid foundation for implementing auto-approval for tools, which allows users to configure which tools should be automatically approved without requiring explicit confirmation. The auto-approval settings include:

- Whether auto-approval is enabled
- The maximum number of consecutive auto-approved requests
- Tool-specific settings to control which tools should be auto-approved

This implementation ensures feature parity with the TypeScript implementation, which supports auto-approval for tools.
