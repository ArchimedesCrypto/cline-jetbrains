test: Add tests for ClineBrowserService and ClineFileService

- Created ClineBrowserServiceTest to test browser functionality
- Created ClineFileServiceTest to test file system operations
- Added tests for all major methods in both services
- Used JUnit 5 and Mockito for testing
- Added TempDir for file system tests

These tests ensure that the browser and file system services work as expected and provide good test coverage for these critical components.
