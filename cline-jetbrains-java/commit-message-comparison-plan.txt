docs: Add TypeScript-Java comparison and feature implementation plan

This commit adds two documentation files:

1. typescript-java-comparison.md - A detailed comparison between the TypeScript and Java implementations of the Cline plugin, identifying gaps and missing features.

2. feature-implementation-plan.md - A comprehensive plan for implementing the missing features, including:
   - Browser functionality implementation using JxBrowser
   - Multiple API providers support
   - Prompt caching implementation
   - MCP integration
   - Auto-approval implementation
   - UI animations

These documents will guide the next phase of development to ensure feature parity between the TypeScript and Java implementations.
