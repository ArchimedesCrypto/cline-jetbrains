Add multiple API providers support and prompt caching

This commit adds support for multiple API providers and prompt caching to the Java implementation of the Cline JetBrains plugin. The changes include:

1. Created an ApiProvider interface that defines the common API for all providers
2. Created a ModelInfo class to store model information
3. Implemented AnthropicProvider with prompt caching support for Claude 3.5 models
4. Implemented OpenAiProvider with support for both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI endpoints
5. Updated ClineApiService to use the provider abstraction
6. Updated ClineSettingsService to include settings for multiple providers
7. Added tests for the new components

These changes ensure feature parity with the TypeScript implementation, which supports multiple API providers and prompt caching for Claude 3.5 models.
