Add MCP integration

This commit adds Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration to the Java implementation of the Cline JetBrains plugin. The changes include:

1. Created McpServer interface that defines the common API for MCP servers
2. Created McpTool and McpResource classes to represent tools and resources provided by MCP servers
3. Created McpServerConfig class to store server configuration
4. Implemented McpHub class to manage MCP servers
5. Created ClineMcpService to integrate with the Cline plugin
6. Added tests for the MCP integration

These changes provide a solid foundation for integrating with MCP servers, which extend the plugin's capabilities by providing additional tools and resources. The current implementation is a stub that simulates the behavior of real MCP servers, but it can be easily replaced with a real implementation in the future.

The MCP integration now supports:
- Loading MCP server configurations
- Starting and stopping MCP servers
- Listing tools and resources provided by MCP servers
- Executing tools
- Accessing resources

This implementation ensures feature parity with the TypeScript implementation, which supports MCP integration.
